## Overview

While working on projects for my Java Programming 2 course, I noticed that the assignments were using the now deprecated javac classes to render the application. In an attempt to understand why they were deprecated, I came across JavaFX. This project allowed me to learn the basics of JavaFX, including what was similar to the javac library and what was not. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- Basic playlist controls
 - Play a song
 - Pause the song
 - Reset the song to the beginning
 - Change to the previous song
 - Skip to the next song
- Adjust the speed of playback
- Adjust the volume

## My process

### Built with

 - Java
 - JavaFX
   - XML
   - CSS3

### What I learned

I got a refresh on the syntax of CSS, learned XML, and how it was used in JavaFX through FXML. 

### Continued development

I would like to add more functionality, such as the ability to select music from a source, some sort of visualizer, and a toggleable playlist.
